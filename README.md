Abstract:
This research project will focus on the use of the word "like" in written language on social media, analysing the use of "like" as a filler word as opposed to it's use as a conjunction.

Background and Prior studies:
The word "like" has undergone a transformation in recent English, in the sense that it can be used in more contexts than before, especially in spoken language while the use in written language has seen less analysis.
